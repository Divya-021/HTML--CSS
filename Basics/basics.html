            An <b>equation</b> is like a weighing balance with <i>equal</i> weights on both sides.
            If we add or subtract the <em>same number</em> from both sides of an equation, <blink>it still holds</blink>.
            <tt>Similarly</tt>, if we multiply or divide the same number into both sides of an equation, it still holds.
            Consider the equation of a line, 3x<sup>2</sup> âˆ’ 2 = 4. Also log<sub>10</sub> can be written like this.
